<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jc. I'm getting back into web development. It'll be a fun journey.</p>

<p>What I like to do on my spare time, is learning new hobbies. I do video editing and also make thumbnails for YouTube.
  I also enjoy drawing because it relaxes me. I learned how to create stickers and I have opened up my Etsy shop. I'm also
  learning how to do game design. I did create assets and a level.
</p>

<p>If I'm not on the computer, I'm driving around trying to find new restaurants to eat at. I also go fishing and I love camping.
  I go to the art museum or the museum of natural science when I get the chance.
